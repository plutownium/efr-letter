        No Matter How Far You Get In Life You’ll Still Feel Behind Unless You Do This
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you never learn to make the right financial moves, automatically, without any worries
        about making an irresponsible decision…
      </p>
      <p>You’ll always be behind.</p>
      <p>You’ll never be ahead.</p>
      <p>Whether it is true or false in actuality, that is how it will feel.</p>
      I’ll tell you a story that describes a person with that exact problem.

      <p>This story is made up but it is nonetheless real.</p>
      <p>Some singular real person could read this story and be like:</p>
      <p>“Is this story about me? Does the author know me? How did he…”</p>
      <p>
        More generally, this story is about every single person who ever compares themselves to
        others. (Is that 99% of people? 100% of people? I don’t know.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, the specific person is imaginary. Yet it is a true story that plays out a thousand
        times a year across the USA.

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Anyway, here’s a story about Thomas Whitman, 49 year old Vice President of an investment
        bank called Goldman Sachs.
      </p>
      <p>Thomas Whitman has been working hard his whole life to get ahead.</p>
      <p>He has 3 kids, who are all wonderful.</p>
      <p>Yet his finances are a mess:</p>
      <p>His net worth is in the negative.</p>
      <p>He thinks he will never escape it, thinks so every day of his life.</p>
      <p>The apparent fact gnaws on him. It wears him away, erodes him, slowly over time.</p>
      <p>
        Thomas Whitman avoids comparing himself to others, because he recognizes that it’s a sure
        fire way to talk yourself into feeling like you are behind. So he avoids doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet he slips and finds himself doing it, because we all fail to achieve our aims sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last time it happened, Thomas was walking up the stairwell at a mansion party with his
        colleague from work, Derek Smith. [Note from the narrator: “He also was an imaginary
        person.”]
      </p>
      <p>
        Derek Smith is a junior associate at the bank and is twenty years younger than Thomas. Yet,
        during the conversation, the topics of investments come up. And Derek says:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, I just finished putting away my third million. My dad helped me out a bit with
        $12,000 when I was a teenager, but from there it was all me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Thomas was shocked, jaw drop level shocked. Because, while he recognized Derek’s story as
        all of extravagant, true, and magnificent…
      </p>

      <!-- // fixme: center it for real -->
      <p class="flex justify-center">Thomas had less money invested than Derek!</p>
      <p class="flex justify-center">A lower total net worth!</p>

      <p>And this lower net worth was at the age of 49, while Derek was only mid 20’s.</p>

      <p>
        And Thomas was Derek’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss! Four levels of formal power above him in
        the organization!
      </p>
      <p>Thomas was struck right to his core with shock:</p>
      <p>A man who started with less than him…</p>
      <p>Who had less help…</p>
      <p>Who was younger by more than twenty years…</p>
      <p>Was ahead of him in terms of net worth.</p>

      <CenteredTextBox>
        <h2>Scary story right?</h2>

        <p>I repeat: This person is not real, yet he exists.</p>
        <p>
          Probably thousands or millions of real people are <span class="underline"
            >just like him</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>People who were born rich or poor, short or tall, weak or strong.</p>
        <p>
          All types of people recognize themselves in the story, because <span class="underline"
            >the story could just as well be about them</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>“If I was Thomas Whitman, I too would feel behind.”</p>
      </CenteredTextBox>

      <p>
        The point of the story is this: <span class="font-bold"
          >No matter how much money you make, if your financial responsibility isn’t there, if your
          habits, routines, attitudes and beliefs aren’t dialed in…</span
        >
      </p>
      <p class="font-bold">
        You will always have an abundance of people who are doing better than you in terms of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, if that was the only problem, and you’d tried to fix it on your own and failed, it
        absolutely would not be commentary on your character. Because trying to improve and failing
        is admirable.
      </p>

      <CenteredTextBox>
        <p>Set yourself up for success. Become financially responsible.</p>

        How Living Within Your Means Gets You Ahead… And How to Make the Most of It
      </h2>

      <p>To be blunt, I’m not sure you get a lot out of this section.</p>
      <p>
        Because to me, the upsides of living within your means… Are obvious. Built in. I’ve lived
        this way for so long, that I take a lot of it for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I don’t take for granted is that <span class="underline"
          >in the domain of net worth, I am ahead of everyone who has more debt than assets</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>If I lose my job or become too sick to work…</p>

      <p>If the naturally recurrent hardships of life try to take me out…</p>

      <p>I’ll tell the indifferent suffering of the universe:</p>

      <p class="font-bold">“lol, lmao, i have enough money to live on for the rest of my life.”</p>
      <p>I am protected.</p>
      <p>
        To the indifferent suffering of the universe, with regards to being or becoming financially
        needy…
      </p>
      <p>
        I am untouchable. It cannot hurt me. <span class="underline"
          >Only I can turn my finances from great into fukt up</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="underline">
        The money is safe from everyone, and everything, but my own negligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I lost my job due to an accident that left me unable to work for five whole years. Five.
        Whole. Years…
      </p>
      <p>I would be fine.</p>
      <p>Here’s what that doesn’t mean:</p>

      <li>It doesn’t mean I can become financially irresponsible.</li>

      <p>I have to keep my spending in check.</p>
      <p>(Yet I earn upwards of $2,000 a month from my investments.)</p>
      <li>
        It doesn’t mean I’m ahead of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals, who have a net worth of over
        $50,000,000 or more.
      </li>
      <p>(Yet I’m ahead of a firm 95% of the population.)</p>
      <li>
        It means that if someone told me I was *financially* irresponsible, <span class="underline"
          >it would be the first time I’d heard it in my entire life</span
        >.
      </li>
      <p>(I am somewhat irresponsible in other domains, but not this one.)</p>
      <p>
        But it doesn’t mean I can drop my guard, take off the guard rails (that I built up with my
        bare hands), and spend willy-nilly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because then people who tell me I've become irresponsible <span class="underline"
          >would be right</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet I am ahead of many people, again, in the specific domain of net worth. It is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>So how do you get ahead by living within your means?</p>

      <ol class="list-disc">
        <li class="list-disc ml-5">
          You are, in a “numbers on a spreadsheet” verifiable way, ahead of the pack.
        </li>

        <p>
          You will be ahead of the pack, better than average. Your accountant or a banker could tell
          you: “Yeah man, you’re doing great.”
        </p>
        <p>
          People from within those two domains tell me regularly. They would tell you too if you
          pursued progress aggressively for a few years. The comments would be rare. The comments
          would be mostly ones you prompted them to give you. <span class="underline"
            >And then once in a while they would tell you that you were admirable</span
          >.
        </p>

        <li class="list-disc ml-5">
          Your future/current husband/wife could tell you: “Um, honey, I chose you for lots of good
          reasons, and your responsible behaviors 100% were among them.”
        </li>
        <li class="list-disc ml-5">
          Your current/future kids could tell you by asking you: “Mom, dad, the kids at school worry
          about their finances. Even the rich ones. Do we need to worry about that?”
        </li>
        <p>
          Enabling you to realize: <span class="underline"
            >No, you pretty fucking firmly do not need to worry</span
          >. (Though you wouldn’t say the cursing part out loud!)
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl">
        Here’s a real activity you could do to make the most of these advantages:
      </h3>

      <p>
        You could use your own character, actions, thoughts and words to set a positive example for
        others to follow. That would get you ahead in a remarkable and positive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hard parts, by the time you are ready to do this, would all be behind you. (Unless you
        count dealing with their doubts as hard; in which case, nevermind.) You would be <span
          class="underline">ready</span
        > to tell anyone who will listen:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, even if you’re starting from zero at age whatever, in two years, you can put a
        massive massive dent in your financial problems.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, it’ll take a decade, but you can expand your investments until they are so large, you
        no longer need to work.” (Note: I don’t recommend Fixed Income, Retire Early, but you could
        do it using the guide if you wanted to.)
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl">Here’s another one:</h3>

      <p>
        You could, in your senior years, begin a permanent and recurrent habit of donating to
        charity.
      </p>
      <p>You could do it willingly, relentlessly, without question.</p>
      <p>
        Because by that point, you’d have applied financially responsible behaviors, for so long,
        for so many years… (If and only if you actually apply it, by the way)
      </p>
      <p>That you’d be able to donate <span class="underline">a hundred dollars a month</span>.</p>
      <p>Or even thousands.</p>
      <p>And it would be easy.</p>
      <p>You wouldn’t notice the money was missing.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-xl">
        Here’s yet another way you could enjoy the interest payments from your retirement account:
      </h3>

      <p>You could live in a decent sized house and buy a Ferrari at age 63.</p>
      <p>
        (I wouldn’t do it, but you could do it if that was the kind of thing that would make
        following the guide super motivating for you. I guarantee it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these things mentioned above: They do, in fact, in a measurable, quantifiable,
        “numbers on a spreadsheet” kind of way, get you ahead of other people.
      </p>
      <p>People who made inferior choices.</p>
      <p>People who have less.</p>
      <p>
        It isn’t good or bad, but rather it is a neutral, factual statement. You would in fact be
        ahead of millions if your net worth was merely zero, because being seriously in debt is the
        rule, not the exception..

        How to Be So Far Ahead of Your Peers, They Wouldn’t Even Believe It! And Why Whether It’s A
        Secret Or Public Knowledge Is Up To You
      </h2>

      <p>
        Some people who read this page will respond favorably to the idea of being ahead of their
        peers. They will see it as a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you agree or disagree about comparing yourself to others being always good, or
        always bad, or somewhere in between…
      </p>
      <p class="underline">
        Having more money than average <span class="font-bold">absolutely is a good thing</span>.
      </p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you are greedy.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you love money more than people.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you are selfish.</p>
      <p>In fact, it means:</p>
      <p>You are and were generous.</p>
      <p>
        You were generous enough to Sacrifice Now For Later, over and over. Not other peoples’ now,
        but your own now.
      </p>
      <p>
        All so you would be able to benefit yourself, and others, when you/they needed you. All in
        pursuit of becoming a financially responsible person.
      </p>
      <p>That is what generous means!</p>
      <p>It means you are and were willing to love people more than money.</p>
      <p>
        The entire page in fact talks about doing things for other people out of of generosity. The
        whole page is about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It means you were altruistic. An altruistic person is happy to sacrifice a little bit of

        I make no assumptions about your gender or sexual preferences, so I will tell you about a

        the truth:
      </p>
      <p class="underline">Financial responsibility is costly.</p>
      <p>
        It means you “skip lattes” in the sense that you don’t spend $2,000 on a new wardrobe when:
      </p>

      <p>You’re already in debt</p>
      <p>You’re already going to earn less than you’ll spend this month.</p>
      <p>
        No, you don’t have to “skip lattes,” because that is a yawn fest and majoring in the minor.
        $5 latte every day, <span class="italic">oh no!</span> $5 * 30 = $150. Boring!
      </p>
      <p>What you do have to do is avoid:</p>
      <p>(1) Making <span class="underline">big</span> financial mistakes</p>
      <p>
        (2) Making <span class="underline">repeated</span> financial mistakes that add up to big ones
        (but if I say lattes you’ll rightly quit reading out of boredom)
      </p>
      <p>But back on topic:</p>
      <p>
        I’m not going to tell you that becoming more financially responsible means <span
          class="underline font-bold">all</span
        >
        desirable partners will want you more. Because that would be a lie. It’s

      <p class="font-bold">And yet it makes you a badass that a good partner will cherish.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, it’s extremely unlikely that they will want you specifically because you’re financially
        responsible. As I said: It isn’t sexy.
      </p>
      <p>But as we will find out, debt isn’t either!</p>

        You’ll like it better even if you’re the laziest, most irresponsible person in the world.

        You’ll also like it <span class="underline">better</span> if you’re industrious, conscientious,

      <p>
        You will adapt to the improvements you make, as a result of choosing to become financially
        responsible. You will adapt to the changes, and they will become nearly permanent. Close,
        but not actually. You could slip up and spiral downwards. It’s true.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s also true is that the calm about your financial concerns will reappear over and over.
      </p>
      <p>Because you actively take steps to solve your financial woes…</p>
      <p>You will eventually subdue your nagging, seemingly lifelong financial fears.</p>
      <p>They’ll disappear entirely for months at a time.</p>
      <p>But not for good, no, not for good.</p>
      <p>Because fear about your financial future is natural.</p>
      <p>Ancient farmers understood that if they did not protect their harvests well…</p>
      <p>They would not eat.</p>
      <p>Ancient hunters understood that if they stalked the same terrain too long…</p>
      <p>They would not eat.</p>
      <p>
        Because of this built-in tendency to fear the future, you absolutely will not be free of
        financial concerns forever.
      </p>
      <p>Yet it will be easier to deal with.</p>
      <p>You’ll suffer less.</p>
      <p>Your defeats will be fewer and easier to deal with.</p>
      <p>
        And the victory you experience as a result of building up <span class="italic"
          >even four thousand dollars</span
        > into your investment accounts…
      </p>
      <p>
        Will quickly spiral out of control <span class="italic">in the good direction</span> if you permit
        yourself to let it happen.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">The Fully Automated Habit That Your Children Will Thank You For</h2>

      <p>
        Given that your children will thank you for your success in various ways… <span
          class="underline">Will you give yourself permission to succeed in this domain?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve talked about the financial habit being “fully automated.” Meaning you will
        <span class="underline">automatically</span> carry out the behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="underline">
        You won’t have to think about whether it’s worth it. You won’t have to think about whether
        it’s doable. You won’t have to talk yourself into getting it done. <span class="font-bold"
          >You’ll just do it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll discover that it is <span class="underline">possible</span> to become that person, and
        in fact guaranteed if you choose to guarantee it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll discover that you had the capacity to be <span class="underline">magnificent</span> in
        finance inside of you all along.
      </p>
      <p>
        What that means is that, <span class="underline"
          >when it comes time to teach your children to be financially responsible, you’ll know all
          the ins and outs of how a person pulls it off.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll be able to tell them which challenges they’ll encounter. You’ll be able to tell them
        how to get it done. You’ll be able to tell them how to go around the challenges, go over the
        challenges, how to push through the challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the challenge of financial responsibility was a wall with no way to go around it, or over
        it, you’d be able to show them how to push on the wall so hard that it breaks, shatters,
        crumbles, in opposition to the force applied to that wall. All to get to the glory on the
        other side.
      </p>
      <p>You’ll know how to break through the wall because you did it yourself.</p>
      <p>You’ll know how to dig through it when all you have is a rusty spoon to dig with.</p>
      <p>Because you did it yourself already.</p>
      <p>
        The metaphor is accurate. You yourself have, at best, only an idea of how to become
        financially responsible. (Or else you would have realized the page was irrelevant to you by
        now.)
      </p>
      <p>Yet if you continue reading, you’ll discover how it’s possible that, in a few years…</p>
      <p>
        <span class="underline"
          >You’ll have changed so much that you would have been happy to pay $5,000 to change that
          way</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then you’ll be able to show your children, when it comes time to show them, how it’s
        done.
      </p>
      <p>
        They will <span class="underline">know</span> it was possible, because you’ll be able to tell
        them:
      </p>
      <p>
        “When I was young, I had debts. I had the wrong habits. The wrong routines. The wrong
        rules.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I made myself better. Built myself up from nothing with a guide I found on the Internet.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I still have the guide that taught me to do it. It’s yours if you want it. I’ll tell you
        how I did it so you can learn from it. *If* you do what I say, and *if* you work on
        understanding why following the advice is a wise decision, <span class="underline"

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl underline">The Joys of Changing For The Better</h3>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>
          The joy of looking at a bank account that has increased 11 months out of 12 for six

        </li>

          That number is very doable.)
        </li>

        <li>Get addicted to progressing, not regressing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now compare that to the next list:</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl underline">Pains Of Staying The Same</h3>
      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Looking at credit card debt piling up</li>
        <li>
          Conflict between the desire to enjoy life and the guilt/sting of more credit card debt

        <li>The pain of knowing that “even if I start now, I’ll already be behind”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In case the previous Joys of Success list wasn’t clear what this is about, here’s another

      <li>
        Conversation with a loved one about how they want to go out and spend, but you can’t join

      <h4 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Or…</h4>

      <li>

      <h4 class="mt-4 text-2xl">This…</h4>
      <li>
        The older version of yourself, at age 60, wrinkles on your face and grey in your hair, still

        </li>

        <li>

        A debtor is getting themselves into a situation that's harder and harder to escape. Means
        they get closer to a life where:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>They have to say no to fun social outings because they can’t afford it</li>

        <li>They can’t replace something that breaks because they can’t afford it</li>

        <li>Lovers won’t marry them because it means adopting all their debt</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Yes, investing means the same at first, but for different reasons. Going somewhere good vs
        not going somewhere bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, an investor is getting themselves into a situation thats better and better and
        better. It snowballs. Until one day in the future they can:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Spend as much as 30x a month what they’d be able to if they were bad with money</li>

        <li>Go out with friends whenever they want to</li>

        <li>Enjoy high quality household items (that last a long time)</li>

        <li>Spend lavishly on their spouse when they want to</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Yes, it means sacrificing some now for more later. But that’s life. You get better by
        sacrificing.

<WideBox>
  <div class="py-8">
    <h2 class="text-center">Think of an image of a lighthouse.</h2>

    <p>
      A lighthouse, standing tall and shining its light off into the distance. Sailing ships use the
      lighthouse to guide them home and keep them safe during turbulent storms. The lighthouse is
      strong and dependable. They are trusted by sailors and accountable for keeping them safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, a person who saves and invests regularly, and avoids credit card debt, acts as a
      beacon of safety.
    </p>

    <p>They guide the way.</p>

    <p>
      This person guards themselves and their family from disasters. You trust them to guide you
      through the unknown, and always be there for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when you have financial trouble, you trust that this person will be solid, dependable,
      and prevent disorder from taking over. They provide a model of good behavior to follow and
      learn from.
    </p>

    <p>You might know someone like this, or you might not.</p>

    <p>
      If you don’t know someone like that, you could ask a handful of people if they know a person
      like that. About thirty percent of them will say yes.
    </p>

    <p>
      However you learn about this type of person, you’ll find that they are cherished, loved, and
      appreciated.
    </p>

    <p>They do a lot for their families.</p>

    <p>Their friends recognize them as dependable.</p>

    <p>Would you like to be one of these reliable types?</p>

    <p>
      Would you be willing to become a beacon of safety, even if just financially, for yourself and
      your family?
    </p>

    <p>Because you know your parents need you to:</p>

    <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
      <li>Be trustworthy with large sums of money, including their money.</li>

      <li>Be able to plan your finances and stick to the plan.</li>

      <li>Be ready to support them when they’re old, both financially and with your time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>…and you can, in fact, experience gratitude for being able to do that.</p>

    <p>You know your spouse will need you to:</p>

    <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
      <li>Be trustworthy with money. (Notice a theme here?)</li>

      <li>Be able to make and stick to a financial plan.</li>

      <li>Be ready to support them in case of an accident or tragedy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>…and you can, in fact, experience gratitude for being able to do that.</p>

    <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
      <li>Be trustworthy with money.</li>

      <li>Show them the difference between good behavior and bad behavior.</li>

      <li>
        Help them understand that saving for a major expenditure, like a car or a school payment, is
        doable even on minimum wage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      …and you’ll experience <span class="font-bold">enormous gratitude</span> for being able to do that
      for them.
    </p>

    <p>So you do want to be someone who can step up to support a family member.</p>

    <p>
      You want to be so reliable that, when tragedy strikes, the tragedy is already minimized by
      your preparedness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, it seems unrealistic for an achievable change like saving money and sticking to a budget
      to make you magnificent all on its own.
    </p>

    <p class="underline">
      Yet over twenty or thirty years, life is bound to throw you a few curve balls.
    </p>

    <p>You want to be firmly in the category called “ready to help.”</p>

    <p>You want to be “ready for anything” or as close to it as you can be.</p>

    <p>It’s the version of you who is financially responsible who can do this.</p>

    <p>It doesn’t even have to be that dire:</p>

    <p>Plainly, your spouse, your parents, your kids…</p>

    <p>
      They all need you to be able to <span class="underline"
        >take care of yourself and your finances</span
      > so they don’t have to do it for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can and will happen, over and over. So what would you prefer? To prepare for it, right?
    </p>

    <p>You know this is the case. You recognize it as truth.</p>

    <p>You can see it coming, if you look far enough ahead, over and over.</p>

    <p>Problem after problem, tragedy after tragedy.</p>

    <p class="font-bold">
      Yet if you are prepared, your will to prepare will have saved you thousands or hundreds of
      thousands of dollars, and provided priceless gains to yourself and others.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl"><span class="underline">Let’s Be Real</span>:</h3>

    <p>
      Routine guilt from debts sucks. It wears you down. Drags your health, your energy. Means you
      have less internal resources available for other issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routine shame from debts sucks. It wears on you, drains your energy. Means you’re too busy
      with the shame of debt to concern yourself with other responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fearing your financial future wears on you. It’s dreadful. You want to avoid the worry that
      you won’t be able to afford a home. Avoid the worry that you’ll be living with your parents 5,
      or 10 years from now. That your kids will wear worn out clothing.
    </p>

    <p>The responsible saver and investor feels great about who he is. (Or she is.)</p>

    <p>The neglectful irresponsible feels guilty, shameful, and takes hits to their self esteem.</p>

    <p>
      But the responsible investor causes their parents to feel at ease about their child’s future.
      Their parents worry less. In contrast, people with debts cause their parents stress and
      concern.
    </p>

    <p class="font-bold">
      The upsides are not limited to the domain of parent-child relationships either:
    </p>

    <p class="font-bold">Financial responsibility also matters to romance.</p>

    <p>
      By becoming someone who grows their net worth, they become a person others want to date/marry.
    </p>

    <p>
      It isn’t a big deal to everyone, but on average, men and women both prefer to be with someone
      who has great finances. People who are a great match really really do care.
    </p>

    <p>
      A high quality person will avoid someone who is in debt. Because they recognize them as
      unreliable.
    </p>

    <p>
      A high quality person will recognize that “has a high net worth” is an attractive quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The type of person who keeps their net worth on the upswing regardless of what life throws at
      them… is a person who will succeed long term. It’s not even about the money: It’s about who
      you become in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      A person with debts is in serious risk of being taken out by one or two tragedies in a row. An
      investor can have several bad outcomes in a row and be OK, and then go on to recover.
    </p>

    <p>
      A financially responsible person is ahead of the pack on at least one important dimension. A
      debtor is lagging behind and has to live with that knowledge.

      <h2>Why I Really Want You to Start Doing All This</h2>

      <p>
        Had I not been an absolute unit of financial responsibility when I met my wife, I wouldn’t
        have been able to marry her.
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold">Her debts might have been too big of a problem for me.</p>

      <p>Had I not been prepared, I would not have been able to marry her when I wanted to.</p>

      <p>
        My resistance to taking on responsibility for her debts would have stopped me from marrying
        her.
      </p>

      <p>Even though she loved me, and I loved her, the burden might have been too much to bear.</p>

      <p>
        I would not have wanted to experience the alternative, and I would not want it for you
        either.
      </p>

      <CenteredTextBox>
        <h2 class="mt-4 text-warning">Straight Up:</h2>
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2 font-bold text-warning">Debt Isn’t Sexy</h2>
      </CenteredTextBox>

      <p>Sensible men and women both avoid partners who have large debts.</p>

      <p>
        My wife has confirmed for me that she found my status as a “confirmed provider” attractive.
        (My words in the quotes, not hers, by the way.)
      </p>

      <p>
        I confirm that her debt was squarely unattractive to me (she said she was OK with me saying
        this, by the way).
      </p>

      <p>“Oh so you married a gold digger.”</p>

      <p>Yeah, about that. Have you seen this diagram before?</p>

      <div class="mt-12 h-76 w-96">
        <img src="/img/image2.png" alt="a venn diagram about my wife" />
      </div>

      <div class="mt-4">
        <p class="">
          “She’s a gold digger!” is a predictable response, so I have to address it. If I didn’t,
          you might miss the point of the article.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>The takeaway is this:</p>

      <p class="italics">
        If you want to marry a gold digger, you could use the guide I want to give you.
      </p>

      <p class="italics">
        But <span class="font-bold"
          >if you want to attract someone who is normal and a great catch,</span
        > you could also use the guide.
      </p>

      <p>PSA: I am not a sucker. I did not marry a gold digger.</p>

      <p>
        The happy halfway point between selfish greed and selfless generosity is <span
          class="underline">prudence</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>Prudence means: “Acting with or showing care and thought for the future.”</p>

      <p>I was able to marry my wife only because I was prudent years in advance.</p>

      <p class="font-bold">
        Yet the question remains: Why would you listen to me? My advice? My methods? Why would you
        implement my advice, my guide?
      </p>

      <p class="">
        <span class="font-bold">And who even am I?</span> (That question will be fully addressed in a
        minute.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="underline">Facts</span>: I was and am generous about helping others fix their
        financial woes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="underline">Facts</span>: I was able to choose to marry someone with $300,000 of
        debt… and then pay it off in less than ten years.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="underline">Facts</span>: I was able to do and be all that precisely because I
        follow the advice in my own guide.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="underline">Facts</span>: I was able to enter into co-ownership of my wife’s
        debts with prudence.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="underline">Facts</span>: I was able to judge myself capable of bearing the
        responsibility with prudence.
      </p>

      <p>(And I was right.)</p>

      <p>
        I live out the advice in my own guide. I follow all my own steps. I don’t do everything
        right all the time, but I try. I get it right most of the time. And guess what?
      </p>

      <p>It works.</p>

      <CenteredTextBox>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl text-center">
          Though people who lack financially responsible habits and attitudes may still be prudent,
          their lack of practice with money has yielded bad results.

      <p>
        The overarching point is that you could lose a great catch because they don’t want to help
        you with your debts.
      </p>

      <p>Let’s examine a few scenarios:</p>

      <p class="underline">Potential Future #1</p>

      <p>
        The year is 2028. You are your future self. You are married. Your spouse tells you they are
        leaving you because they don’t want to help you with your debts anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        It feels bad and worse, it’s a disaster. You got divorced and lost the person who was
        helping you clean up your own mess out of the goodness of their heart.
      </p>

      <p class="underline">Potential Future #2</p>

      <p>
        The year is 2028. You are dating someone. You are madly in love, but your relationship is
        having problems.
      </p>

      <p>Your spouse tells you they are “trying so hard to not be expensive” during a fight.</p>

      <p>
        You realize you are dragging them down, and you are forced to leave them so they can do
        better.
      </p>

      <p class="underline">Potential Future #3</p>

      <p>
        The year is 2031. You are single. The last person you had a crush on told you: “Sorry,
        you’re a great person, but I can’t allow myself to marry someone who’s financially
        irresponsible.”
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold">None of the scenes are guaranteed, and yet they are all plausible.</p>

      <p>I say in conclusion:</p>

            Who Am I To Tell You How To Guide Yourself Out Of Even The Worst Financial Ruin Of Your
            Life?
          </h2>
        </CenteredTextBox>
      </div>

      <p>Real talk: Why would you listen to me?</p>

      <p>
        (1) I married into over $300,000 of non-mortgage debt in my mid-20s and in under 5 years I
        turned my net worth very positive with just a normal, boring, salaried position.
      </p>

      <p>
        I gained the debt via marriage. But I was able to <span class="underline">choose</span> to
        tackle my wife’s financial problems on her behalf with a
        <span class="underline">complete conviction</span> that I would prevail.
      </p>

      <p>
        And indeed I did. The debt was paid off aggressively. Part of why I was able to pay it off
        so aggressively is that <span class="underline">I was prepared</span>.
      </p>

      <p>(2) I am a credentialed actuary.</p>

      <p>
        An actuary uses math and statistics to estimate the financial impact of uncertainty and
        helps clients minimize risk.
      </p>

      <p>Yes. I am credentialed in all sorts of finance and risk.</p>

      <p>
        So, crunching numbers and comparing alternative solutions is both (1) my day job, and (2) my
        second source of income.
      </p>

      <p>My Substack readers tell me my advice is good.</p>

      <p class="font-bold">
        Still, for the beginner and intermediate student, or for people who are still in the “pay
        off your debts” stage of personal finance, my Substack would be irrelevant.
      </p>

      <p>Yet I want to help that crowd. So I asked myself:</p>

      <p>How could I do it?</p>

      <p>This guide was the end result.</p>

      <p>
        I grew up in a single mother home and mother F’er, though she would have if she could have,
        was unable to help us in understanding finance and math. I had to help with bills (both make
        money to pay them and actually figure out finances).
      </p>

      <p>
        The information most people get is scattered, poor, or downright harmful. I basically had to
        figure it out on my own. A financial product that helps lay out the basics would have let us
        jump ahead instead of struggling to piece it together through trial and error.
      </p>

      <p>Lots of budget guys are overly prescriptive. I strive to do otherwise.</p>

      <p>
        Lots of get out of debt advice rely on inefficient rules (snowball method, credit card
        balance transfers, etc) instead of focusing on automating a system.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast, I strive to automate not only your external behaviors, but your internal self…
        By making finance easy and rewarding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lots of saving and investing advice is generic. For people who don’t love finance, spending
        a ton of time in a spreadsheet looking at it is terrible.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast, I offer a way to do it once, and then you just have 1 account to monitor. It's
        simple but works.
      </p>

      <p>Gooroos want to tell you that it’s complicated. But I believe it can be simple:</p>

      <p>
        My advice doesn’t involve uprooting your life. Other gooroos tell people to put cash in
        envelopes and be super cheap. Instead I tell you to automate the automatable things and then
        once you do that, you just look at one account and spend… keeping yourself in check as
        needed, automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe finance is important. People are in massive debt, ignore their struggles, and are
        one bad break away from being completely screwed.
      </p>

      <p>
        When over half of Americans can’t afford a surprise $500 bill and an entire generation is
        struggling to pay student loans, there must be a lack of helpful information.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I wrote this guide for you, because you deserve to get all the info you need all in one
        spot, if you want that.

        Why It’ll Work Even If You’re A Young Adult With Low Income, Have Been In Debt For Years,
        and Have No Idea How You’ll Ever Afford A House
      </h2>

      <p>I’ll address these entirely reasonable questions one by one.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">(1) It'll Work Even If You’re A Young Adult With Low Income</h3>

      <p>You’re a young adult with low income?</p>

      <p>Good, good. You’re one of the types of people I wanted to help with this guide.</p>

      <p>A young adult with low income will:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Read the guide.</li>

        <li>Apply the guide.</li>

        <li>
          Have lots of time to push through, to break through, challenges and barriers in their way.
        </li>

        <li>
          Likely recognize they are young. So they will be willing to think about the guide’s
          meanings.
        </li>

        <li>
          Because young adults are not “so far behind” the way a 45 year old person with $0 net
          worth would be, they will have an easier time acting on the info.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Trust me, as a young adult, points (3) and (4) and (5) will do a lot for you.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">(2) It'll Work Even If You’ve Been In Debt For Years</h3>

      <p>You’ve been in debt for years?</p>

      <p>Good, good. You’re one of the types of people I wanted to help with this guide.</p>

      <p>A person who has been in debt for years will:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Read the guide.</li>

        <li>Apply the guide.</li>

        <li>Appreciate the guide and its wisdom.</li>

        <li>
          Have enough money to pay off their debts, or else they would have spiraled out beyond
          control by now (financially).
        </li>

        <li>
          Understand the sensation of paying off their last dollar of debt will be a slow & steady
          build to an orgasm quality relief and be inclined to act.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        (Hint: I know exactly how it feels to rid myself of my last dollar of a $300,000 debt. It is
        a GOOD feeling.)
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        (3) It'll Work Even If You Have No Idea How You’ll Afford A House
      </h3>

      <p>You have no idea how you’ll afford a house?</p>

      <p>
        This is beyond good. In fact: It’s great. You’re one of the types of person I would love to
        help.
      </p>

      <p>You’re someone I want to disabuse of the notion that they are stuck.</p>

      <p>
        That they will have to live with their parents, or rent an apartment, their entire lives.
      </p>

      <p>A person who has no idea how they’ll afford a house will:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Read the guide.</li>
        <li>Apply the guide.</li>

        <li>Appreciate the hope that it brings them.</li>

        <li>Act on the hope that it brings them.</li>

        <li>
          Recognize, after a few months of doing it: “Hey, Effer was right. I had it inside me all
          along.”
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Notice How My Responses Were Kind Of The Same?</h2>

      <p>It’s a similar path, similar story, available for everyone to tell about themselves.</p>

      <p>
        I’ll tell you right now: It is possible. You can do it. I’ve thought about people and what
        they’re like. I’ve crunched the numbers. Seen the math.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m here to tell you that “I have no idea how to afford a house” makes you perfect for this
        offer. As does “I’m too far in debt,” and/or “I’m too young to start.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Because, then, when you do discover how you’ll afford a house, how it’s not “too early” to
        start investing, or “too late” to start paying off a debt…
      </p>

      <p>That you do have the resources, the energy, the time, the money, to get it done…</p>

      <p>It’s a victory for both of us.</p>

      <p>
        Because when you do put your first dollar down into an investment account made specifically
        for your house…
      </p>

      <div>
        <CenteredTextBox>
          <h3 class="text-2xl mt-4">
            I’ll have helped you give yourself a gift that only you can give.
          </h3>

          <p>(Cliche, I know, but watch this…)</p>

          <p>I’ll help you wrap the gift.</p>

          <p>I’ll tell you where to get the present.</p>

          <p>I’ll show you the best way to wrap the gift.</p>

          <p>Tie the knot.</p>

          <p>And yet only you can give yourself the gift.</p>
        </CenteredTextBox>
      </div>

      <p>
        So if you’ll give yourself <span class="font-bold">permission</span> to believe that even though
        you currently have no idea how to afford a house right now, it remains possible…
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ll give yourself <span class="font-bold">permission</span> to believe that you aren’t
        too young to start investing…
      </p>

      <p><span class="font-bold">Permission</span> to believe that you can pay off your debts…</p>

      <p>You’ll move yourself the first inch of a long mile towards your dream.</p>

      <p>
        And, because you’ll like the change, it will simply be <span class="font-bold"
          >too late</span
        > for you to stop yourself from changing.
      </p>

      <p>And while it is “just a guide”...</p>

      <p>
        The victory of moving into your first house: You can start that battle here. Make no
        mistake: It is a battle.
      </p>

      <p>But it’s also normal to win that battle, more normal than you might think…</p>

      <p>Even for people without the guide!</p>

      <p>
        Here’s the high level summary of how the guide works for every type of person the guide
        might help:
      </p>

      <p class="underline">First, you’ll pay off your debts.</p>

      <p>
        Yes, it’s a boring, boring habit if you aren’t excited by progress. Yet you will become
        addicted to it within a few months. Because… you do like progress!
      </p>

      <p class="underline">
        Second, you’ll start funneling the money you used to pay off your debt into investments.
      </p>

      <p>Yes, it will also become addictive if you do it right.</p>

      <p class="underline">Third, you’ll keep doing it.</p>

      <p class="underline">
        Fourth, you will never allow yourself to go back into credit card debt.
      </p>

      <p class="underline">
        Fifth, some day, when you judge yourself to be ready, you’ll yank enough money for a down
        payment on a house out of your investment accounts, and…
      </p>

      <CenteredTextBox>
        <h2 class="mt-4 text-mid-blue font-bold">You Will Own A House!</h2>
      </CenteredTextBox>

      <p>See? Wasn’t that better than a bunch of boring numbers?</p>

      <p>Here’s what you’ll get in terms of relief right away:</p>

      <p>
        (1) While paying off debts, you’ll recognize that the progress you made was possible, and so
        more progress is also possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) While investing into your investment accounts, you’ll recognize, again, that progress
        was possible all along.

      </h2>

      <p>
        I wrote higher up on the page that this is a guide aimed at beginners and intermediates.
      </p>

      <p>
        My substack contains advice for advanced savers and investors. People who have all their

      <p>But you aren’t those people… not yet.</p>

      </p>

      <p>That means you’ll receive specific and detailed instructions about how to...</p>

      <p>(1) In section 1, you’ll see how to adopt the right mindset. It includes:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>How the word “deserve” fits into your financial vocabulary.</li>

        <li>Whether you should start later or right now.</li>

        <li>How to recognize big decisions and small ones (yes, we mention lattes)</li>

        <li>How systems and habits are key to a lasting success.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>(2) In section 2, you’ll learn how to get out of debt. This section includes:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Whether to do it like an avalanche or a snowball</li>

        <li>The difference between Bad Debt, Less Bad Debt and almost entirely benign debt…</li>

        <li>
          Why some debts might not be worth paying at all. (Spoiler: These debts are not your credit
          card debts.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>(3) In section 3, you’ll learn how to set up a budget, including:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>How to assess your situation… and why Abundance Mindsets can be misleading.</li>

        <li>Your Budget Basics in four easy steps.</li>

        success. Including:

          <p>Does the info in the guide really work?</p>
        </CenteredTextBox>
      </div>

      <p>Well, if you’re asking yourself that right now, here’s the answer:</p>

      <p>It is the system I use for myself.</p>

      <p>
        I married into over a quarter million in student loan debt + live in an expensive area/got
        married/started a family. Had over $300k in non mortgage debt and a mortgage. In under 10
        years, I got it paid off and hit a 7 figure net worth.
      </p>

      <p>I spend 20 minutes a month on our personal finances with the system.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl">But the question remains: Why invest in changing your life?</h2>

      <h2>Why do you need to act now?</h2>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Here’s why:</h2>

      <h2 class="mt-2 mb-4">
        <span class="underline">You stumbled upon this page by chance</span>.
      </h2>

      <p>
        You didn’t really know you were on your way here before you decided to look at the page.
      </p>

      <p>Yet you arrived. That’s the definition of blind luck.</p>

      <p>And at this point, we’ve talked about:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>
          Why your parents, if you are lucky enough to still have them, need to up your game

        <li>Why your current or future spouse needs you to up your game financially</li>
        <li>Why your current or future kids need you to up your game financially</li>
        <li>Why you, yourself, right now, need you to up your game financially</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Those are all great points, and they are great on their own. Yet you might want a specific
        reminder about what it is about you that brought you here.
      </p>

      <p>
        See, you’re a responsible type. Maybe not the most responsible, but to a degree, you fit in
        that category.
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold">
        You also recognize that the momentum you’ve built up towards change, internally, will pass.

        If you leave and do not act now, you’ll go back to being the same person you were before you
        got to the page.

      <p>
        That means the odds of being unable to pay for a giant, unforeseen bill, will go up. If
        you’re lucky enough to live a long time, in fact, it’s guaranteed you’ll have a few.
      </p>

      <p>
        It means the day when a spouse, a child, a parent, needs your help financially, is moving
        closer and closer… yet you are not prepared.
      </p>

      <p>Yet you’re ready to act now, not later.</p>

      <p>If you don’t act, the moment will pass.</p>

      <p>
        And the day when you’re a hero for being prepared with a large bank account of Rainy Day
        Money will never arrive.
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold">But the Rainy Day itself will still come.</p>

      <p>You want to be prepared for it by having $0 credit card debt.</p>

      <h2>Here are some reasonable thoughts you could still have out of concern for yourself…</h2>
      <h2>Out of a desire to make the right choice for yourself…</h2>
      <h2>Right now…</h2>
      <h2>And responses to them.</h2>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: “Effer, I am too busy to act on the advice in your
        guide.”
      </h3>

      <p>
        That’s right! Your life may, in fact, be super busy. I can’t tell from this side of the
        screen so you are trusted to tell yourself the truth on the matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have responsibilities to handle. You have people to take care of. You have pressing
        concerns to make allowances for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet the advice in the guide will take less than 10 hours of initial setup time, less than 5
        if you’re fast.
      </p>

      <p>From there, the only change you have to make to your schedule is:</p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Add some more income generating activities, or</li>

        <li>Reduce your spending to get yourself out of debt, and then</li>

        <li>
          Be willing and able to setup an investment account (again in less than ten hours) some
          months down the line.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Choosing to make more income usually takes time, true. Yet choosing to spend less for a few
        months or years while you work yourself out of debt… Takes less time, because you avoid:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Having to think about the purchase</li>

        <li>Having to use the purchase</li>

        <li>Having to clean up the empty packaging of the purchase</li>

        <li>
          Having to restrain yourself from avoiding ruining the gains of the purchase (hard, but
          nigh zero cost in terms of time)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have a total of twenty free hours over the next six months or less, you will find a
        way to make time for the guide. You can promise yourself that right now.
      </p>

      <p>In fact, you can promise yourself all that even if you believe…</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl"><span class="underline">Thought</span>: This won’t work for me</h3>

      <p>
        Your success with the guide is up to you. However I encourage you to ask yourself: but why?
        Why won’t it work for you? Be specific. For instance:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Do you lack the time?</li>

        <li>Do you lack the desire?</li>

        <li>Do you lack the belief that you can pull it off?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you find yourself saying “yes, yes” to any of those questions, you are encouraged to
        re-read the rest of the page and look for the time, the desire, or the belief that you can
        pull it off in the pages.
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold">
        What you can believe is that paying off debt and investing in the future are both good
        behaviors that are self-reinforcing.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ll allow yourself to start, and allow yourself to proceed, you will get the victory
        you’re after.
      </p>

      <p>It will become automatic.</p>

      <p>You will build the habit and character into yourself of your own doing.</p>

      <p>And speaking of character…</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: This will make me into a Scrooge.
      </h3>

      <p>That may happen. Nothing in the guide talks about avoiding becoming Scrooge himself.</p>

      <p>
        Yet the way you are now will get you somewhere worse. <span class="font-bold"
          >Scrooge is a rich penny pincher, but being in debt your whole life means you pinch
          pennies anyway.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>So if the next thought seems relevant to you also, you should read that segment too…</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: I don’t have enough income for this advice to be
        relevant.
      </h3>

      <p>
        If you don’t have enough income for this advice to be relevant now, you also won’t have
        enough income for the guide later. Because you’ll never learn how easy it can be to get
        there… from the guide!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you don’t build good financial habits while you lack money, you’ll always lack money. The
        future where you have enough money for building good financial habits will never arrive.
        It’s a catch 22.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about it. What happens when you spend guiltlessly, take no care for wisdom, and still
        manage to progress from whatever income level you’re at now, to 30% more? To 80% more?
      </p>

      <p>
        If you still suck at budgeting and investing, at making good choices, when you have more
        income than you do now…
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll end up with the same things you have now: Debts and a way-too-tiny investment
        account.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: I don’t need to save for a house yet, OR…
      </h3>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: I don’t know if I’ll want to buy a house.
      </h3>

      <p>
        That is completely fine. You don’t need to want to buy a house to make investing in your
        future and your family’s future worthwhile.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s up to you what you do with the guide, but a house would have been an obvious choice for
        most readers, so I put it in there. You can go without or skip the “buy a house” part.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone is welcome to use the guide to pay off debts and learn to invest, even you just
        want to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-with-bullets pl-5">
        <li>Stop losing $86 a month to debt payments</li>

        <li>Start putting away $100 a month of savings or investments</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Incidentally, if you wonder whether you’ll ever even want your own house, I recommend
        reading the response to the following thought as well…
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: I don’t need to think about my kids’ future yet
        OR...
      </h3>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: I don’t know if I’ll have kids.
      </h3>

      <p>
        One thing I learned when I was young man was that I can’t accurately predict what I’ll want
        in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned by making both right and wrong moves that had permanently life-changing
        consequences. (Not mentioned on the page, by the way!)
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned by realizing, time after time, that I had neglected preparation for my current
        problems & opportunities… all by failing to recognize that one day, I might really wish I
        had been prepared for the desire.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lesson is that it is possible to fail to prepare for something you develop the desire to
        have later, not now.
      </p>

      <p>Now:</p>

      <p>Are you able to see yourself in that story?</p>

      <p>If so, you tell me what you should do about it…</p>

      <p>
        And on the topic of what you should do about it, the following thought might still get in
        your way somehow, so let’s address it…
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: Saving and investing money isn’t important.
      </h3>

      <p>
        If you read the whole page or even most of it and you are still 100% convinced the thought
        is true, you are invited to go do something else; my guide is not for you.
      </p>

      <p>However, the entire page is dedicated to conflict with the belief.</p>

      <p>
        You have ample opportunity to re-read the page and think about the statement, and whether it
        is true or false.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe you’re an Ultra High Net Worth Individual. If so, maybe you inherited enough
        financially responsible habits that the guide would be useless to you. Because it’s already
        “built in.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But if not, to be blunt, I don’t know how you can read the whole page and still believe
        this. Really. Do it and see what you believe when you’re done.
      </p>

      <p>It is a long page, so take your time.</p>

      <p>And speaking of taking your time reading things…</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: “It’s 100 pages long? I won’t be able to finish it.”
      </h3>

      <p>
        A 10 page guide would be more finishable. However, you wouldn’t get enough actionable advice
        to actually implement the advice. In contrast, this guide will take you from where you’re at
        – wherever that is – and go with you for years.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also choose to consume the guide in ten minutes a week for twenty weeks, for a total
        of 200 minutes of invested time. You would begin receiving the upsides of reading the guide
        immediately.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: I’ll buy it and won’t apply it.
      </h3>

      <p>
        That is up to you. I can’t make you apply it. However, you should know that there are
        clearly given actions to take at the end of each chapter.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should also know that i<span class="underline"
          >f you break the task of following the guide down into clear, actionable, appealing and
          bite-sized steps, you will want to use the guide.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, you are invited to press Ctrl + S and <span class="underline"
          >save the whole page</span
        > to remind yourself of why you chose to invest in yourself and your future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because if you re-read it every few months, you’ll never ever have the following thought:
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">
        <span class="underline">Thought</span>: The cost of applying the guide is too high.
      </h3>

      <p>
        The immediate and short term costs are indeed large and will take you a lot of time, money
        and other resources you suppose you cannot get back.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have every reason to wonder about whether the cost is too big for the expected returned
        value it will provide.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, as a responsible saver and investor myself, I want to tell you my real opinion on
        the matter:
      </p>

      <p>
        The cost isn’t too high. You don’t have any better way to sacrifice in the Money category:
      </p>

      <p>The time it takes is negligible compared to the time it will free up later.</p>

      <p>
        The money is negligible compared to the money the decision will return back to you over
        time. The energy you’ll spend is less than the energy you’ll gain by being stress-free about
        money.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ll say it once more so I’m sure I said it at least once in response to all these worries
        and concerns: If you get the guide, and you try several times to apply the guide, and you
        encounter trouble…
      </p>

      <p>
        You are welcome to DM me for further instructions. I don’t promise I’ll respond right away,
        or the very first time you message me. But as a customer, if I recognize you, you will get
        help.
      </p>

      <p>With all that out of the way, tell me…</p>
