        Would you like to be a disciplined winner in at least one major game of life? Namely the
        money game.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Would you like to find out about how to become a person who acts as if they were addicted to
        a positive, life changing behavior…
      </p>

      <p>So that you end up doing it without any internal effort whatsoever to act on the habit?</p>

      <h2>No Matter How Far You Get In Life You’ll Still Feel Behind Unless You Do This</h2>

      <p>
        If you never learn to make the right financial moves, automatically, without any worries
        about making an irresponsible decision…
      </p>
      <p>You’ll always be behind.</p>
      <p>You’ll never be ahead.</p>
      <p>Whether it is true or false in actuality, that is how it will feel.</p>
      I’ll tell you a story that describes a person with that exact problem.

      <p>This story is made up but it is nonetheless real.</p>
      <p>Some singular real person could read this story and be like:</p>
      <p>“Is this story about me? Does the author know me? How did he…”</p>
      <p>
        More generally, this story is about every single person who ever compares themselves to
        others. (Is that 99% of people? 100% of people? I don’t know.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, the specific person is imaginary. Yet it is a true story that plays out a thousand
        times a year across the USA.
      </p>

      <!-- // todo: img, of dr Manhattan -->

      <p>
        Anyway, here’s a story about Thomas Whitman, 49 year old Vice President of an investment
        bank called Goldman Sachs.
      </p>
      <p>Thomas Whitman has been working hard his whole life to get ahead.</p>
      <p>He has 3 kids, who are all wonderful.</p>
      <p>Yet his finances are a mess:</p>
      <p>His net worth is in the negative.</p>
      <p>He thinks he will never escape it, thinks so every day of his life.</p>
      <p>The apparent fact gnaws on him. It wears him away, erodes him, slowly over time.</p>
      <p>
        Thomas Whitman avoids comparing himself to others, because he recognizes that it’s a sure
        fire way to talk yourself into feeling like you are behind. So he avoids doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet he slips and finds himself doing it, because we all fail to achieve our aims sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last time it happened, Thomas was walking up the stairwell at a mansion party with his
        colleague from work, Derek Smith. [Note from the narrator: “He also was an imaginary
        person.”]
      </p>
      <p>
        Derek Smith is a junior associate at the bank and is twenty years younger than Thomas. Yet,
        during the conversation, the topics of investments come up. And Derek says:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, I just finished putting away my third million. My dad helped me out a bit with
        $12,000 when I was a teenager, but from there it was all me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Thomas was shocked, jaw drop level shocked. Because, while he recognized Derek’s story as
        all of extravagant, true, and magnificent…
      </p>

      <!-- // fixme: center it for real -->
      <p class="flex justify-center">Thomas had less money invested than Derek!</p>
      <p class="flex justify-center">A lower total net worth!</p>

      And this lower net worth was at the age of 49, while Derek was only mid 20’s.

      <p>
        And Thomas was Derek’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss! Four levels of formal power above him in
        the organization!
      </p>
      <p>Thomas was struck right to his core with shock:</p>
      <p>A man who started with less than him…</p>
      <p>Who had less help…</p>
      <p>Who was younger by more than twenty years…</p>
      <p>Was ahead of him in terms of net worth.</p>

      <div>
        <!-- // todo: convert to CenteredTextBox -->
        <h2>Scary story right?</h2>

        <p>I repeat: This person is not real, yet he exists.</p>
        <p>Probably thousands or millions of real people are just like him.</p>
        <p>People who were born rich or poor, short or tall, weak or strong.</p>
        <p>
          All types of people recognize themselves in the story, because the story could just as
          well be about them.
        </p>
        <p>“If I was Thomas Whitman, I too would feel behind.”</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The point of the story is this: No matter how much money you make, if your financial
        responsibility isn’t there, if your habits, routines, attitudes and beliefs aren’t dialed
        in…
      </p>
      <p>
        You will always have an abundance of people who are doing better than you in terms of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, if that was the only problem, and you’d tried to fix it on your own and failed, it
        absolutely would not be commentary on your character. Because trying to improve and failing
        is admirable.

      <h2>How Living Within Your Means Gets You Ahead… And How to Make the Most of It</h2>

      <p>To be blunt, I’m not sure you get a lot out of this section.</p>
      <p>
        Because to me, the upsides of living within your means… Are obvious. Built in. I’ve lived
        this way for so long, that I take a lot of it for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I don’t take for granted is that in the domain of net worth, i am ahead of everyone who
        has more debt than assets.
      </p>
      <p>If I lose my job or become too sick to work…</p>
      <p>“lol, lmao, i have enough money to live on for the rest of my life.”</p>
      <p>I am protected.</p>
      <p>
        The indifferent suffering of the universe, with regards to being or becoming financially
        needy…
      </p>
      <p>
        I am untouchable. It cannot hurt me. Only I can turn my finances from great into fukt up.
      </p>
      <p>The money is safe from everyone, and everything, but my own negligence.</p>
      <p>
        If I lost my job due to an accident that left me unable to work for five whole years. Five.
        Whole. Years…
      </p>
      <p>I would be fine.</p>
      <p>Here’s what that doesn’t mean:</p>

      <li>It doesn’t mean I can become financially irresponsible.</li>

      <p>I have to keep my spending in check.</p>
      <p>(Yet I earn upwards of $2,000 a month from my investments.)</p>
      <li>
        It doesn’t mean I’m ahead of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals, who have a net worth of over
        $50,000,000 or more.
      </li>
      <p>(Yet I’m ahead of a firm 95% of the population.)</p>
      <li>
        It means that if someone told me I was *financially* irresponsible, it would be the first
        time I’d heard it in my entire life.
      </li>
      <p>(I am somewhat irresponsible in other domains, but not this one.)</p>
      <p>
        But it doesn’t mean I can drop my guard, take off the guard rails (that I built up with my
        bare hands), and spend willy-nilly.
      </p>
      <p>Because then people who tell me I've become irresponsible would be right.</p>

      <p>
        Yet I am ahead of many people, again, in the specific domain of net worth. It is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>So how do you get ahead by living within your means?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You are, in a “numbers on a spreadsheet” verifiable way, ahead of the pack.</li>

        <p>
          You will be ahead of the pack, better than average. Your accountant or a banker could tell
          you: “Yeah man, you’re doing great.”
        </p>
        <p>
          People from within those two domains tell me regularly. They would tell you too if you
          pursued progress aggressively for a few years. The comments would be rare. The comments
          would be mostly ones you prompted them to give you. And then once in a while they would
          tell you that you were admirable.
        </p>

        <li>
          Your future/current husband/wife could tell you: “Um, honey, I chose you for lots of good
          reasons, and your responsible behaviors 100% were among them.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Your current/future kids could tell you by asking you: “Mom, dad, the kids at school worry
          about their finances. Even the rich ones. Do we need to worry about that?”
        </li>
        <p>
          Enabling you to realize: No, you pretty fucking firmly do not need to worry. (Though you
          wouldn’t say the cursing part out loud!)
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h3>Here’s a real activity you could do to make the most of these advantages:</h3>

      <p>
        You could use your own character, actions, thoughts and words to set a positive example for
        others to follow. That would get you ahead in a remarkable and positive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hard parts, by the time you are ready to do this, would all be behind you. (Unless you
        count dealing with their doubts as hard; in which case, nevermind.) You would be ready to
        tell anyone who will listen:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, even if you’re starting from zero at age whatever, in two years, you can put a
        massive massive dent in your financial problems.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, it’ll take a decade, but you can expand your investments until they are so large, you
        no longer need to work.” (Note: I don’t recommend Fixed Income, Retire Early, but you could
        do it using the guide if you wanted to.)
      </p>

      <h3>Here’s another one:</h3>

      <p>
        You could, in your senior years, begin a permanent and recurrent habit of donating to
        charity.
      </p>
      <p>You could do it willingly, relentlessly, without question.</p>
      <p>
        Because by that point, you’d have applied financially responsible behaviors, for so long,
        for so many years… (If and only if you actually apply it, by the way)
      </p>
      <p>That you’d be able to donate a hundred dollars a month.</p>
      <p>Or even thousands.</p>
      <p>And it would be easy.</p>
      <p>You wouldn’t notice the money was missing.</p>

      <h3>
        Here’s yet another way you could enjoy the interest payments from your retirement account:
      </h3>

      <p>You could live in a decent sized house and buy a Ferrari at age 63.</p>
      <p>
        (I wouldn’t do it, but you could do it if that was the kind of thing that would make
        following the guide super motivating for you. I guarantee it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these things mentioned above: They do, in fact, in a measurable, quantifiable,
        “numbers on a spreadsheet” kind of way, get you ahead of other people.
      </p>
      <p>People who made inferior choices.</p>
      <p>People who have less.</p>
      <p>
        It isn’t good or bad, but rather it is a neutral, factual statement. You would in fact be
        ahead of millions if your net worth was merely zero, because being seriously in debt is the
        rule, not the exception..

      <p>
        Some people who read this page will respond favorably to the idea of being ahead of their
        peers. They will see it as a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you agree or disagree about comparing yourself to others being always good, or
        always bad, or somewhere in between…
      </p>
      <p>Having more money than average absolutely is a good thing.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you are greedy.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you love money more than people.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you are selfish.</p>
      <p>In fact, it means:</p>
      <p>You are and were generous.</p>
      <p>
        You were generous enough to Sacrifice Now For Later, over and over. Not other peoples’ now,
        but your own now.
      </p>
      <p>
        All so you would be able to benefit yourself, and others, when you/they needed you. All in
        pursuit of becoming a financially responsible person.
      </p>
      <p>That is what generous means!</p>
      <p>It means you are and were willing to love people more than money.</p>
      <p>
        The entire page in fact talks about doing things for other people out of of generosity. The
        whole page is about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It means you were altruistic. An altruistic person is happy to sacrifice a little bit of
        himself for later.

        I make no assumptions about your gender or sexual preferences, so I will tell you about a

        the truth:
      </p>
      <p>Financial responsibility is costly.</p>
      <p>
        It means you “skip lattes” in the sense that you don’t spend $2,000 on a new wardrobe when:
      </p>

      <p>You’re already in debt</p>
      <p>You’re already going to earn less than you’ll spend this month.</p>
      <p>
        No, you don’t have to “skip lattes,” because that is a yawn fest and majoring in the minor.
        $5 latte every day, oh no. $5 * 30 = $150. BORING!
      </p>
      <p>What you do have to do is avoid:</p>
      <p>Making big financial mistakes</p>
      <p>
        Making repeated financial mistakes that add up to big ones (but if I say lattes you’ll
        rightly quit reading out of boredom)
      </p>
      <p>But back on topic:</p>
      <p>
        I’m not going to tell you that becoming more financially responsible means all desirable
        partners will want you more. Because that would be a lie. It’s definitely not all of them.
        But guessing that more of them will like the financially responsible version of you more is
        accurate.

      <p>
        And participating in the habit this page talks about is not only going to generate money for

      </div>

      <p>
        I’m not going to tell you that being financially responsible is sexy. Quite the opposite. To
        most people, it’s dull and boring.
      </p>
      <p>And yet it makes you a badass that a good partner will cherish.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, it’s extremely unlikely that they will want you specifically because you’re financially
        responsible. As I said: It isn’t sexy.
      </p>
      <p>But as we will find out, debt isn’t either!</p>
      <p>
        In fact, we both know that having six figures of debt would be a repellent in the dating
        pool.

      <p>
        (The remaining half will mostly be people who simply do not care about the quality of your
        bank account.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the return on investment on your financial responsibility is sky high. Because becoming

          I said this was about “normal, boring, yet special automated habits you haven’t heard

          means:
        </h3>
      </div>

      <p>
        Everyone and their mother has heard of setting up an automatic transfer from their chequing
        account into their savings account.
      </p>
      <p>It is not special.</p>
      <p>What is special is the change that will occur along the way.</p>
      <p>
        The change that will happen after you’ve set up the totally yawn-inducing “banking
        automation.”
      </p>
      <p>It is an internal change.</p>
      <p>The automated habit is not the bank’s or some software program’s, but your own.</p>
      <p>And acquisition of the habit only happens along the way, and after you start doing it.</p>
      <p>This is a promise to you.</p>
      <p>I guarantee you will get it.</p>
      <p>You will experience the following change:</p>
      <p>You will grow to appreciate having the money.</p>
      <p>
        You will like it better than the way your life was before. Because the old version of you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Had debts for months or years that cost them significant cash… every single month.</li>
        <li>Had routine pains and stresses due to a lack of cash… every single month.</li>
        <li>Feared being jobless for even two months at a time… every single month.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You’ll like it better even if you’re the laziest, most irresponsible person in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll also like it better if you’re industrious, conscientious, responsible, or any
        combination of those qualities.
      </p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>
        The Secret Sauce: When you build up your financial habits, blah blah blah automate your bank
        account, boring boring yawn, is not the whole story.
      </p>

      <h3>The SAUCE is that you change. You. Not just your bank account.</h3>

      <p>
        Since the norm is to be in debt, having a net worth of even one dollar makes you better than
        average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you satisfied being average, or worse, below average, in the specific category of
        financial success?
      </p>
      <p>I bet you aren’t.</p>
      <p>I bet you want to improve that shit.</p>
      <p>And that is fucking awesome.</p>
      <p>But if wanting is good, doing is even better.</p>
      <p>This is the boring, normal, special automated habit that will get you ahead:</p>

      </h2>

      <p>The boring part of this segment is that eight hours of setup will earn you millions.</p>
      <p>That’s cool. Don’t get me wrong. That is cool, very cool.</p>
      <p>But it is boring. Way too normal of a statement to be cool.</p>
      <p>You can hear about it elsewhere.</p>

      <h3>
        But you can hear “if you can’t hang onto your money, no amount of earning will give you a
        high net worth” here, and you can hear it almost nowhere else.
      </h3>

      <p>That statement should excite you.</p>
      <p>
        Because the inverse is true also: “If you can hang onto your money, even a small amount of
        earning will give you a high net worth.”
      </p>

        <h3>How long do you want to be alive for? A long time, right?</h3>

        <p>Well, do you want those years to be spent as a disciplined winner?</p>
        <p>Do you want a long, long, thirty year streak of win, after win, after win?</p>
        <p>Do you want your L’s to be fewer, less frequent, smaller?</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Yes, you have to do the eight hours of setup, and then talk yourself out of disturbing the
        routine once it gets itself going.
      </p>
      <p>No, it isn’t easy to start for every single person who does it.</p>
      <p>
        Yet if the text on this page is right for you, you will manage to pull off becoming a
        disciplined winner.

        If the page speaks to you, seems like it’s about you, seems like the “wow, this reader cares
        about his family” part is in fact about you…
      </p>

      <p>You have what it takes to be the Disciplined Winner described in the section title.</p>

      <h3>Remember:</h3>

      <h3>If your life is long and happy and filled with successes…</h3>

      <h3>One day, you’re gonna be OLD.</h3>

      <p>
        What are you willing to do to make sure that old version of you, the old version who is
        physically and mentally frail, has a LOT of excess cash?
      </p>
      <p>When the hair on your head is old and gray…</p>
      <p>And you need someone to help you walk up the stairs…</p>
      <p>Do you want your kids to have to take time out of the day to help you?</p>
      <p>Which of these two sets of options sounds better to you?</p>

      <p>Which set of options do you prefer?</p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>Set of Options #1</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You have to ask your kids for money to keep ownership of your tiny apartment.</li>
            <li>You are accurately described by “did not amount to much.”</li>
            <li>You’ll never leave anything to your kids when you die.</li>
            <li>
              You were haunted by memories of how you failed to give your parents’ any money back in
              thanks for all they did for you. For decades.
            </li>
            <li>
              You were haunted by memories of your kids having less than other kids on the block.
              For decades.
            </li>
            <li>They learned from your mistakes, not your successes.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Set of Options #2</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Your kids learned what everyday greatness looks like by watching you.</li>
            <li>
              Your grandkids had lots of happy stories from you about times your strengths
              overwhelmed your weaknesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              You give your kids money every time they ask, which is rare, because you taught them
              well.
            </li>
            <li>You donate to charities you support in your spare time.</li>
            <li>
              You LOVE yourself for all the work you did on your character in your
              whatever-decade-of-life-you’re-in-now.

          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Attention: The second set of options is remarkably, undeniably better!</h3>

      <p>
        You will adapt to the improvements you make, as a result of choosing to become financially
        responsible. You will adapt to the changes, and they will become nearly permanent. Close,
        but not actually. You could slip up and spiral downwards. It’s true.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s also true is that the calm about your financial concerns will reappear over and over.
      </p>
      <p>Because you actively take steps to solve your financial woes…</p>
      <p>You will eventually subdue your nagging, seemingly lifelong financial fears.</p>
      <p>They’ll disappear entirely for months at a time.</p>
      <p>But not for good, no, not for good.</p>
      <p>Because fear about your financial future is natural.</p>
      <p>Ancient farmers understood that if they did not protect their harvests well…</p>
      <p>They would not eat.</p>
      <p>Ancient hunters understood that if they stalked the same terrain too long…</p>
      <p>They would not eat.</p>
      <p>
        Because of this built-in tendency to fear the future, you absolutely will not be free of
        financial concerns forever.
      </p>
      <p>Yet it will be easier to deal with.</p>
      <p>You’ll suffer less.</p>
      <p>Your defeats will be fewer and easier to deal with.</p>
      <p>
        And the victory you experience as a result of building up even four thousand dollars into
        your investment accounts…
      </p>
      <p>
        Will quickly spiral out of control in the good direction if you permit yourself to let it
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>I say again:</p>
      <p>You have to give yourself permission to succeed.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The Fully Automated Habit That Your Children Will Thank You For</h2>

      <p>
        Given that your children will thank you for your success in various ways… Will you give
        yourself permission to succeed in this domain?
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve talked about the financial habit being “fully automated.” Meaning you will
        automatically carry out the behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        You won’t have to think about whether it’s worth it. You won’t have to think about whether
        it’s doable. You won’t have to talk yourself into getting it done. You’ll just do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll discover that it is possible to become that person, and in fact guaranteed if you
        choose to guarantee it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll discover that you had the capacity to be that magnificent inside of you all along.
      </p>
      <p>
        What that means is that, when it comes time to teach your children to be financially
        responsible, you’ll know all the ins and outs of how a person pulls it off.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll be able to tell them which challenges they’ll encounter. You’ll be able to tell them
        how to get it done. You’ll be able to tell them how to go around the challenges, go over the
        challenges, how to push through the challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the challenge of financial responsibility was a wall with no way to go around it, or over
        it, you’d be able to show them how to push on the wall so hard that it breaks, shatters,
        crumbles, in opposition to the force applied to that wall. All to get to the glory on the
        other side.
      </p>
      <p>You’ll know how to break through the wall because you did it yourself.</p>
      <p>You’ll know how to dig through it when all you have is a rusty spoon to dig with.</p>
      <p>Because you did it yourself already.</p>
      <p>
        The metaphor is accurate. You yourself have, at best, only an idea of how to become
        financially responsible. (Or else you would have realized the page was irrelevant to you by
        now.)
      </p>
      <p>Yet if you continue reading, you’ll discover how it’s possible that, in a few years…</p>
      <p>
        You’ll have changed so much that you would have been happy to pay $5,000 to change that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then you’ll be able to show your children, when it comes time to show them, how it’s
        done.
      </p>
      <p>They will know it was possible, because you’ll be able to tell them:</p>
      <p>
        “When I was young, I had debts. I had the wrong habits. The wrong routines. The wrong
        rules.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I made myself better. Built myself up from nothing with a guide I found on the Internet.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I still have the guide that taught me to do it. It’s yours if you want it. I’ll tell you
        how I did it so you can learn from it. *If* you do what I say, and *if* you work on
        understanding why following the advice is a wise decision, it will work for you too.”

    <p>What would financial success be worth to you?</p>
    <p>Here’s the answer I would give if the story were about me and my children:</p>
    <p>Everything.</p>

    <!-- // fixme: make this text REALLY BIG. -->
    <h2>If You Read This Far, It’s Time For The Big Reveal</h2>

    <p>The entire document you’re reading right now is not “just” about finances.</p>
    <p>It’s about love.</p>
    <p>
      Do you love yourself enough to follow a guide given to you from an expert in debt reduction
      and net worth enhancement?
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you willing to do a little work (but truthfully not much) every month or two to manage
      your own behavior…
    </p>
    <p>So that your current or future spouse can rely on you when they need to?</p>
    <p>
      So that your current or future kids can trust you to teach them about care and responsibility?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you answer affirmatively, and yet you recognize that some challenges are guaranteed along
      the way…
    </p>
    <p>You are saying that yourself and your family are entirely, entirely worth doing this for.</p>
    <p>(And if you can't will yourself to do it, it’s still about love. Just in another way.)</p>
    <p>
      Whether you do or don’t, you must acknowledge, at the minimum, that choosing to do so would be
      a firmly affirmative sign…
    </p>
    <p>That you want to be a hero for somebody!</p>
    <p>Out of love.</p>

      <h2>A Reminder of What This Is About</h2>

      <p>
        Here are some experiences you can reasonably expect to achieve while using and applying the
        previously mentioned guide:
      </p>

      <h3>The Joys of Changing For The Better</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The joy of looking at a bank account that has increased 11 months out of 12 for six
          straight years. (You missed a payment in February; no one’s perfect.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Retiring early at the age of 49, early enough to spend all the time you want with your
          grandkids if and when you have them
        </li>
        <li>
          Earn $30,000/year passively from investments even though people making 5x your income
          “don’t think it’s possible for them to save” and then list a bunch of excuses. (Spoiler:
          That number is very doable.)
        </li>

        <li>Get addicted to progressing, not regressing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now compare that to the next list:</p>

      <h3>Pains of staying the same</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Looking at credit card debt piling up</li>
        <li>
          Conflict between the desire to enjoy life and the guilt/sting of more credit card debt
        </li>

        <li>The pain of knowing that “even if I start now, I’ll already be behind”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In case the previous Joys of Success list wasn’t clear what this is about, here’s another
        list:
      </p>
      <h4>Would you rather have…</h4>

      <li>
        Conversation with a loved one about how they want to go out and spend, but you can’t join
        them because of debt.
      </li>

      <h4>Or…</h4>

      <li>
        Conversation with a loved one about how they’re “really pleased” with their net worth
        growing “automatically” because of interest.
      </li>

      <h4>This…</h4>
      <li>
        The older version of yourself, at age 60, wrinkles on your face and grey in your hair, still
        stuck going to work every day because you didn’t save up.
      </li>

      <h4>Or this?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          That same older version of yourself, but you’re retired, laying on the couch at 11 am,
          having a nap on a Tuesday.
        </li>

        <li>
          Seeing interest added to the savings account every month. “+$30.97” on top of money you
          already add to routinely.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>If You’ve Read This Far… Do You Get It Yet?</h2>

      <p>
        A debtor is getting themselves into a situation that's harder and harder to escape. Means
        they get closer to a life where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They have to say no to fun social outings because they can’t afford it</li>

        <li>They can’t replace something that breaks because they can’t afford it</li>

        <li>Lovers won’t marry them because it means adopting all their debt</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Yes, investing means the same at first, but for different reasons. Going somewhere good vs
        not going somewhere bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, an investor is getting themselves into a situation thats better and better and
        better. It snowballs. Until one day in the future they can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Spend as much as 30x a month what they’d be able to if they were bad with money</li>

        <li>Go out with friends whenever they want to</li>

        <li>Enjoy high quality household items (that last a long time)</li>

        <li>Spend lavishly on their spouse when they want to</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Yes, it means sacrificing some now for more later. But that’s life. You get better by
        sacrificing.
      </p>
      <p>So:</p>

      <p>Which type of person do you want to be?</p>

    <!-- // todo: centered text box (whole thing) -->

      <h2>Ask yourself what this would be like:</h2>

      <h2>Not only seen as irresponsible, but in truth, a dependably undependable person.</h2>

      <h3>“Even when I come across money, I lose it within a few weeks or months.”</h3>

      <p>Is that who you want to be?</p>

      <p>Would that be good?</p>

      <p>What if you could become the opposite?</p>

      <p>You’d enjoy comments like:</p>

      <p>“So dependable I don’t know what I’d do without him!”</p>

      <p>“My dad/husband/son got out of debt over six years ago.”</p>

      <p>“My mother has protected me from lots of financial hardship…”</p>

      <p>“As long as I’ve known her, her finances have always been in order.”</p>

      <p>High net worth is significantly better than the alternative:</p>

      <p>You are lying to yourself if you think it isn’t.</p>

      <!-- // todo: huge huge text -->
      <h2>Burdened by debt, unable to be depended on by others.</h2>

      <h2>Is that who you want to be?</h2>

      <h2>No, it’s not who you want to be.</h2>

      <h3>You want to be great… or as great as you can.</h3>

      <h3>And you’re here to find out that it is possible.</h3>

      <p>
        Because you know that some day your kids, your spouse, your mom or your dad, will need you.
      </p>

      <p>They’ll need you to be:</p>

      <p>Trustworthy.</p>

      <p>Dependable.</p>

      <p>Responsible.</p>

      <p>Resourceful.</p>

      <p>Reliable.</p>

      <p>Prudent.</p>

      <h3>Now:</h3>

      <h3>Let’s do something to really drive the point home:</h3>
    </div>
  </PaddingBox></StandardBox
>

<WideBox>
  <div>
    <h2>Think of an image of a lighthouse.</h2>

    <p>
      A lighthouse, standing tall and shining its light off into the distance. Sailing ships use the
      lighthouse to guide them home and keep them safe during turbulent storms. The lighthouse is
      strong and dependable. They are trusted and accountable for keeping sailors safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, a person who saves and invests regularly, and avoids credit card debt, acts as a
      beacon of safety.
    </p>

    <p>They guide the way.</p>

    <p>
      This person guards themselves and their family from disasters. You trust them to guide you
      through the unknown, and always be there for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when you have financial trouble, you trust that this person will be solid, dependable,
      and prevent disorder from taking over. They provide a model of good behavior to follow and
      learn from.
    </p>

    <p>You might know someone like this, or you might not.</p>

    <p>
      If you don’t know someone like that, you could ask a handful of people if they know a person
      like that. About thirty percent of them will say yes.
    </p>

    <p>
      However you learn about this type of person, you’ll find that they are cherished, loved, and
      appreciated.
    </p>

    <p>They do a lot for their families.</p>

    <p>Their friends recognize them as dependable.</p>

    <p>Would you like to be one of these reliable types?</p>

    <p>
      Would you be willing to become a beacon of safety, even if just financially, for yourself and
      your family?
    </p>

    <p>Because you know your parents need you to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be trustworthy with large sums of money, including their money.</li>

      <li>Be able to plan your finances and stick to the plan.</li>

      <li>Be ready to support them when they’re old, both financially and with your time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>…and you can, in fact, experience gratitude for being able to do that.</p>

    <p>You know your spouse will need you to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be trustworthy with money. (Notice a theme here?)</li>

      <li>Be able to make and stick to a financial plan.</li>

      <li>Be ready to support them in case of an accident or tragedy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>…and you can, in fact, experience gratitude for being able to do that.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be trustworthy with money.</li>

      <li>Show them the difference between good behavior and bad behavior.</li>

      <li>
        Help them understand that saving for a major expenditure, like a car or a school payment, is
        doable even on minimum wage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      …and you’ll experience immense, humongous, great giant heaping piles of gratitude for being
      able to do that for them.
    </p>

    <p>So you do want to be someone who can step up to support a family member.</p>

    <p>
      You want to be so reliable that, when tragedy strikes, the tragedy is already minimized by
      your preparedness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, it seems unrealistic for an achievable change like saving money and sticking to a budget
      to make you magnificent all on its own.
    </p>

    <p>Yet over twenty or thirty years, life is bound to throw you a few curve balls.</p>

    <p>You want to be firmly in the category called “ready to help.”</p>

    <p>You want to be “ready for anything” or as close to it as you can be.</p>

    <p>It’s the version of you who is financially responsible who can do this.</p>

    <p>It doesn’t even have to be that dire:</p>

    <p>Plainly, your spouse, your parents, your kids…</p>

    <p>
      They all need you to be able to take care of yourself and your finances so they don’t have to
      do it for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can and will happen, over and over. So what would you prefer? To prepare for it, right?
    </p>

    <p>You know this is the case. You recognize it as truth.</p>

    <p>You can see it coming, if you look far enough ahead, over and over.</p>

    <p>Problem after problem, tragedy after tragedy.</p>

    <p>
      Yet if you are prepared, your will to prepare will have saved you thousands or hundreds of
      thousands of dollars, and provided priceless gains to yourself and others.
    </p>

      Routine guilt from debts sucks. It wears you down. Drags your health, your energy. Means you
      have less internal resources available for other issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routine shame from debts sucks. It wears on you, drains your energy. Means you’re too busy
      with the shame of debt to concern yourself with other responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fearing your financial future wears on you. It’s dreadful. You want to avoid the worry that
      you won’t be able to afford a home. Avoid the worry that you’ll be living with your parents 5,
      or 10 years from now. That your kids will wear worn out clothing.
    </p>

    <p>The responsible saver and investor feels great about who he is. (Or she is.)</p>

    <p>The neglectful irresponsible feels guilty, shameful, and takes hits to their self esteem.</p>

    <p>
      But the responsible investor causes their parents to feel at ease about their child’s future.
      Their parents worry less. In contrast, people with debts cause their parents stress and
      concern.
    </p>

    <p>The upsides are not limited to the domain of parent-child relationships either:</p>

    <p>Financial responsibility also matters to romance.</p>

    <p>
      By becoming someone who grows their net worth, they become a person others want to date/marry.
    </p>

    <p>
      It isn’t a big deal to everyone, but on average, men and women both prefer to be with someone
      who has great finances. People who are a great match really really do care.
    </p>

    <p>
      A high quality person will avoid someone who is in debt. Because they recognize them as
      unreliable.
    </p>

    <p>
      A high quality person will recognize that “has a high net worth” is an attractive quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The type of person who keeps their net worth on the upswing regardless of what life throws at
      them… is a person who will succeed long term. It’s not even about the money: It’s about who
      you become in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      A person with debts is in serious risk of being taken out by one or two tragedies in a row. An
      investor can have several bad outcomes in a row and be OK, and then go on to recover.
    </p>

    <p>
      A financially responsible person is ahead of the pack on at least one important dimension. A
      debtor is lagging behind and has to live with that knowledge.

      <h2>Why I Really Want You to Start Doing All This</h2>

      <p>
        Had I not been an absolute unit of financial responsibility when I met my wife, I wouldn’t
        have been able to marry her.
      </p>

      <p>Her debts might have been too big of a problem for me.</p>

      <p>Had I not been prepared, I would not have been able to marry her when I wanted to.</p>

      <p>
        My resistance to taking on responsibility for her debts would have stopped me from marrying
        her.
      </p>

      <p>Even though she loved me, and I loved her, the burden might have been too much to bear.</p>

      <p>
        I would not have wanted to experience the alternative, and I would not want it for you
        either.
