        Would you like to be a disciplined winner in at least one major game of life? Namely the
        money game.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Would you like to find out about how to become a person who acts as if they were addicted to
        a positive, life changing behavior…
      </p>

      <p>So that you end up doing it without any internal effort whatsoever to act on the habit?</p>

      <h2>No Matter How Far You Get In Life You’ll Still Feel Behind Unless You Do This</h2>

      <p>
        If you never learn to make the right financial moves, automatically, without any worries
        about making an irresponsible decision…
      </p>
      <p>You’ll always be behind.</p>
      <p>You’ll never be ahead.</p>
      <p>Whether it is true or false in actuality, that is how it will feel.</p>
      I’ll tell you a story that describes a person with that exact problem.

      <p>This story is made up but it is nonetheless real.</p>
      <p>Some singular real person could read this story and be like:</p>
      <p>“Is this story about me? Does the author know me? How did he…”</p>
      <p>
        More generally, this story is about every single person who ever compares themselves to
        others. (Is that 99% of people? 100% of people? I don’t know.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, the specific person is imaginary. Yet it is a true story that plays out a thousand
        times a year across the USA.
      </p>

      <!-- // todo: img, of dr Manhattan -->

      <p>
        Anyway, here’s a story about Thomas Whitman, 49 year old Vice President of an investment
        bank called Goldman Sachs.
      </p>
      <p>Thomas Whitman has been working hard his whole life to get ahead.</p>
      <p>He has 3 kids, who are all wonderful.</p>
      <p>Yet his finances are a mess:</p>
      <p>His net worth is in the negative.</p>
      <p>He thinks he will never escape it, thinks so every day of his life.</p>
      <p>The apparent fact gnaws on him. It wears him away, erodes him, slowly over time.</p>
      <p>
        Thomas Whitman avoids comparing himself to others, because he recognizes that it’s a sure
        fire way to talk yourself into feeling like you are behind. So he avoids doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet he slips and finds himself doing it, because we all fail to achieve our aims sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last time it happened, Thomas was walking up the stairwell at a mansion party with his
        colleague from work, Derek Smith. [Note from the narrator: “He also was an imaginary
        person.”]
      </p>
      <p>
        Derek Smith is a junior associate at the bank and is twenty years younger than Thomas. Yet,
        during the conversation, the topics of investments come up. And Derek says:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, I just finished putting away my third million. My dad helped me out a bit with
        $12,000 when I was a teenager, but from there it was all me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Thomas was shocked, jaw drop level shocked. Because, while he recognized Derek’s story as
        all of extravagant, true, and magnificent…
      </p>

      <!-- // fixme: center it for real -->
      <p class="flex justify-center">Thomas had less money invested than Derek!</p>
      <p class="flex justify-center">A lower total net worth!</p>

      And this lower net worth was at the age of 49, while Derek was only mid 20’s.

      <p>
        And Thomas was Derek’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss! Four levels of formal power above him in
        the organization!
      </p>
      <p>Thomas was struck right to his core with shock:</p>
      <p>A man who started with less than him…</p>
      <p>Who had less help…</p>
      <p>Who was younger by more than twenty years…</p>
      <p>Was ahead of him in terms of net worth.</p>

      <div>
        <!-- // todo: convert to CenteredTextBox -->
        <h2>Scary story right?</h2>

        <p>I repeat: This person is not real, yet he exists.</p>
        <p>Probably thousands or millions of real people are just like him.</p>
        <p>People who were born rich or poor, short or tall, weak or strong.</p>
        <p>
          All types of people recognize themselves in the story, because the story could just as
          well be about them.
        </p>
        <p>“If I was Thomas Whitman, I too would feel behind.”</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The point of the story is this: No matter how much money you make, if your financial
        responsibility isn’t there, if your habits, routines, attitudes and beliefs aren’t dialed
        in…
      </p>
      <p>
        You will always have an abundance of people who are doing better than you in terms of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, if that was the only problem, and you’d tried to fix it on your own and failed, it
        absolutely would not be commentary on your character. Because trying to improve and failing
        is admirable.

      <h2>How Living Within Your Means Gets You Ahead… And How to Make the Most of It</h2>

      <p>To be blunt, I’m not sure you get a lot out of this section.</p>
      <p>
        Because to me, the upsides of living within your means… Are obvious. Built in. I’ve lived
        this way for so long, that I take a lot of it for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I don’t take for granted is that in the domain of net worth, i am ahead of everyone who
        has more debt than assets.
      </p>
      <p>If I lose my job or become too sick to work…</p>
      <p>“lol, lmao, i have enough money to live on for the rest of my life.”</p>
      <p>I am protected.</p>
      <p>
        The indifferent suffering of the universe, with regards to being or becoming financially
        needy…
      </p>
      <p>
        I am untouchable. It cannot hurt me. Only I can turn my finances from great into fukt up.
      </p>
      <p>The money is safe from everyone, and everything, but my own negligence.</p>
      <p>
        If I lost my job due to an accident that left me unable to work for five whole years. Five.
        Whole. Years…
      </p>
      <p>I would be fine.</p>
      <p>Here’s what that doesn’t mean:</p>

      <li>It doesn’t mean I can become financially irresponsible.</li>

      <p>I have to keep my spending in check.</p>
      <p>(Yet I earn upwards of $2,000 a month from my investments.)</p>
      <li>
        It doesn’t mean I’m ahead of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals, who have a net worth of over
        $50,000,000 or more.
      </li>
      <p>(Yet I’m ahead of a firm 95% of the population.)</p>
      <li>
        It means that if someone told me I was *financially* irresponsible, it would be the first
        time I’d heard it in my entire life.
      </li>
      <p>(I am somewhat irresponsible in other domains, but not this one.)</p>
      <p>
        But it doesn’t mean I can drop my guard, take off the guard rails (that I built up with my
        bare hands), and spend willy-nilly.
      </p>
      <p>Because then people who tell me I've become irresponsible would be right.</p>

      <p>
        Yet I am ahead of many people, again, in the specific domain of net worth. It is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>So how do you get ahead by living within your means?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>You are, in a “numbers on a spreadsheet” verifiable way, ahead of the pack.</li>

        <p>
          You will be ahead of the pack, better than average. Your accountant or a banker could tell
          you: “Yeah man, you’re doing great.”
        </p>
        <p>
          People from within those two domains tell me regularly. They would tell you too if you
          pursued progress aggressively for a few years. The comments would be rare. The comments
          would be mostly ones you prompted them to give you. And then once in a while they would
          tell you that you were admirable.
        </p>

        <li>
          Your future/current husband/wife could tell you: “Um, honey, I chose you for lots of good
          reasons, and your responsible behaviors 100% were among them.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Your current/future kids could tell you by asking you: “Mom, dad, the kids at school worry
          about their finances. Even the rich ones. Do we need to worry about that?”
        </li>
        <p>
          Enabling you to realize: No, you pretty fucking firmly do not need to worry. (Though you
          wouldn’t say the cursing part out loud!)
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h3>Here’s a real activity you could do to make the most of these advantages:</h3>

      <p>
        You could use your own character, actions, thoughts and words to set a positive example for
        others to follow. That would get you ahead in a remarkable and positive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hard parts, by the time you are ready to do this, would all be behind you. (Unless you
        count dealing with their doubts as hard; in which case, nevermind.) You would be ready to
        tell anyone who will listen:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, even if you’re starting from zero at age whatever, in two years, you can put a
        massive massive dent in your financial problems.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, it’ll take a decade, but you can expand your investments until they are so large, you
        no longer need to work.” (Note: I don’t recommend Fixed Income, Retire Early, but you could
        do it using the guide if you wanted to.)
      </p>

      <h3>Here’s another one:</h3>

      <p>
        You could, in your senior years, begin a permanent and recurrent habit of donating to
        charity.
      </p>
      <p>You could do it willingly, relentlessly, without question.</p>
      <p>
        Because by that point, you’d have applied financially responsible behaviors, for so long,
        for so many years… (If and only if you actually apply it, by the way)
      </p>
      <p>That you’d be able to donate a hundred dollars a month.</p>
      <p>Or even thousands.</p>
      <p>And it would be easy.</p>
      <p>You wouldn’t notice the money was missing.</p>

      <h3>
        Here’s yet another way you could enjoy the interest payments from your retirement account:
      </h3>

      <p>You could live in a decent sized house and buy a Ferrari at age 63.</p>
      <p>
        (I wouldn’t do it, but you could do it if that was the kind of thing that would make
        following the guide super motivating for you. I guarantee it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these things mentioned above: They do, in fact, in a measurable, quantifiable,
        “numbers on a spreadsheet” kind of way, get you ahead of other people.
      </p>
      <p>People who made inferior choices.</p>
      <p>People who have less.</p>
      <p>
        It isn’t good or bad, but rather it is a neutral, factual statement. You would in fact be
        ahead of millions if your net worth was merely zero, because being seriously in debt is the
        rule, not the exception..

      <p>
        Some people who read this page will respond favorably to the idea of being ahead of their
        peers. They will see it as a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you agree or disagree about comparing yourself to others being always good, or
        always bad, or somewhere in between…
      </p>
      <p>Having more money than average absolutely is a good thing.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you are greedy.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you love money more than people.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t mean that you are selfish.</p>
      <p>In fact, it means:</p>
      <p>You are and were generous.</p>
      <p>
        You were generous enough to Sacrifice Now For Later, over and over. Not other peoples’ now,
        but your own now.
      </p>
      <p>
        All so you would be able to benefit yourself, and others, when you/they needed you. All in
        pursuit of becoming a financially responsible person.
      </p>
      <p>That is what generous means!</p>
      <p>It means you are and were willing to love people more than money.</p>
      <p>
        The entire page in fact talks about doing things for other people out of of generosity. The
        whole page is about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It means you were altruistic. An altruistic person is happy to sacrifice a little bit of
        himself for later.

        I make no assumptions about your gender or sexual preferences, so I will tell you about a

        the truth:
      </p>
      <p>Financial responsibility is costly.</p>
      <p>
        It means you “skip lattes” in the sense that you don’t spend $2,000 on a new wardrobe when:
      </p>

      <p>You’re already in debt</p>
      <p>You’re already going to earn less than you’ll spend this month.</p>
      <p>
        No, you don’t have to “skip lattes,” because that is a yawn fest and majoring in the minor.
        $5 latte every day, oh no. $5 * 30 = $150. BORING!
      </p>
      <p>What you do have to do is avoid:</p>
      <p>Making big financial mistakes</p>
      <p>
        Making repeated financial mistakes that add up to big ones (but if I say lattes you’ll
        rightly quit reading out of boredom)
      </p>
      <p>But back on topic:</p>
      <p>
        I’m not going to tell you that becoming more financially responsible means all desirable
        partners will want you more. Because that would be a lie. It’s definitely not all of them.
        But guessing that more of them will like the financially responsible version of you more is
        accurate.

      <p>
        And participating in the habit this page talks about is not only going to generate money for

      </div>

      <p>
        I’m not going to tell you that being financially responsible is sexy. Quite the opposite. To
        most people, it’s dull and boring.
      </p>
      <p>And yet it makes you a badass that a good partner will cherish.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, it’s extremely unlikely that they will want you specifically because you’re financially
        responsible. As I said: It isn’t sexy.
      </p>
      <p>But as we will find out, debt isn’t either!</p>
      <p>
        In fact, we both know that having six figures of debt would be a repellent in the dating
        pool.

      <p>
        (The remaining half will mostly be people who simply do not care about the quality of your
        bank account.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the return on investment on your financial responsibility is sky high. Because becoming

          I said this was about “normal, boring, yet special automated habits you haven’t heard

          means:
        </h3>
      </div>

      <p>
        Everyone and their mother has heard of setting up an automatic transfer from their chequing
        account into their savings account.
      </p>
      <p>It is not special.</p>
      <p>What is special is the change that will occur along the way.</p>
      <p>
        The change that will happen after you’ve set up the totally yawn-inducing “banking
        automation.”
      </p>
      <p>It is an internal change.</p>
      <p>The automated habit is not the bank’s or some software program’s, but your own.</p>
      <p>And acquisition of the habit only happens along the way, and after you start doing it.</p>
      <p>This is a promise to you.</p>
      <p>I guarantee you will get it.</p>
      <p>You will experience the following change:</p>
      <p>You will grow to appreciate having the money.</p>
      <p>
        You will like it better than the way your life was before. Because the old version of you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Had debts for months or years that cost them significant cash… every single month.</li>
        <li>Had routine pains and stresses due to a lack of cash… every single month.</li>
        <li>Feared being jobless for even two months at a time… every single month.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You’ll like it better even if you’re the laziest, most irresponsible person in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll also like it better if you’re industrious, conscientious, responsible, or any
        combination of those qualities.
      </p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>
        The Secret Sauce: When you build up your financial habits, blah blah blah automate your bank
        account, boring boring yawn, is not the whole story.
      </p>

      <h3>The SAUCE is that you change. You. Not just your bank account.</h3>

      <p>
        Since the norm is to be in debt, having a net worth of even one dollar makes you better than
        average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you satisfied being average, or worse, below average, in the specific category of
        financial success?
      </p>
      <p>I bet you aren’t.</p>
      <p>I bet you want to improve that shit.</p>
      <p>And that is fucking awesome.</p>
      <p>But if wanting is good, doing is even better.</p>
      <p>This is the boring, normal, special automated habit that will get you ahead:</p>

      </h2>

      <p>The boring part of this segment is that eight hours of setup will earn you millions.</p>
      <p>That’s cool. Don’t get me wrong. That is cool, very cool.</p>
      <p>But it is boring. Way too normal of a statement to be cool.</p>
      <p>You can hear about it elsewhere.</p>

      <h3>
        But you can hear “if you can’t hang onto your money, no amount of earning will give you a
        high net worth” here, and you can hear it almost nowhere else.
      </h3>

      <p>That statement should excite you.</p>
      <p>
        Because the inverse is true also: “If you can hang onto your money, even a small amount of
        earning will give you a high net worth.”

        <p>Well, do you want those years to be spent as a disciplined winner?</p>
        <p>Do you want a long, long, thirty year streak of win, after win, after win?</p>
        <p>Do you want your L’s to be fewer, less frequent, smaller?</p>
